# Much Ado About Meeting

MuchAdoAboutMeeting is a web application inspired by [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) for thespian robots performing in Shakespeareâ€™s plays. The site allows users who wish to re-enact Shakespearean plays to organize and join Shakespearean groups and events. The front end utilizes the Flux architectural pattern with React.js and consumes a RESTful API served by a Ruby on Rails back end.
